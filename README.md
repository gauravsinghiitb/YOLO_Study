## YOLO Algorithm (You Only Look Once)

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional methods that apply a classifier to image regions, YOLO frames object detection as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images in one evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Unified Architecture**: Combines region proposal and classification in a single neural network.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of processing images at high frame rates (e.g., 45 FPS in YOLOv3).
- **Single Forward Pass**: Detects multiple objects in one forward pass of the network.
- **Grid-Based Prediction**: Divides the image into grids, with each predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities.

YOLO has evolved through multiple versions (v1, v2, v3, v4, YOLOv5, and beyond), improving in accuracy, speed, and flexibility with each iteration.

### Applications:
- Autonomous driving
- Video surveillance
- Industrial automation
- Real-time image recognition on mobile devices
